# EPICS Training Documentation

[![Deploy mdBook site to Pages](https://github.com/jeonghanlee/epics-training/actions/workflows/mdbook.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeonghanlee/epics-training/actions/workflows/mdbook.yml)

This guide is designed to assist in developing and testing Input/Output Controllers (IOCs) using a streamlined and scalable approach. Our focus isn't on the fundamental functionality of EPICS, but rather on a development process that emphasizes how to quickly transition from a single-device IOC to one that manages multiple pieces of equipment.

This specific EPICS environment is designed to simplify the development process, ensure code quality, and promote consistency across all IOC projects. Our approach aims to eliminate the tedious, error-prone procedures often associated with traditional EPICS development and deployment.

This documentation is built and published through our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, ensuring that you always have access to the latest information.
